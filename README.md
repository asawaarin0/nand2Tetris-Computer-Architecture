# nand2tetris

All my projects for the Nand2Tetris computer architecture course are listed here. The first 5 projects dealt with the hardware hierarchy while the rest of the 7 projects dealt with the software heirarchy. 

Project 1 - Built the  Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux, Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, and DMux8Way chips using Hardware Description Language 

Project 2- Built the HalfAdder, FullAdder, Add16, Inc16, and the ALU using Hardware Description Language.

Project 3- Built the Bit, Register, RAM8, RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K, RAM16K, and Program Counter chips using Hardware Description Language.

Project 4- Wrote a program in assembly language that multiplies two numbers located in 2 different registers and stores the result in another resgister. Also wrote a program in assembly language that blackens the whole screen(turns on all the pixels) when any key is pressed and makes the screen white again(turns of all the pixels) when the pressed key is released.

Project 5- Built the Memory, CPU, and Computer chips using Hardware Description Language.

Project 6- Wrote a program that translates programs written in symbolic Hack assembly language(the assembly language used in this course) into binary code that can be executed on the Hardware Platform built in the previous projects.

Project 7- Built a Basic VM Translator that translates the VM's stack arithmetic and memory access commands to symbolic hack language. 

Project 8- Completed the VM Translator built in Project 7 by adding support for the translation of branching and function calling commands. 

Project 9- Wrote a hangman game in the Jack high level language for which a compiler would be built in future projects. The main goal behind this project was to get used to the high level language so that building the compiler would be easier. 

Project 10- Wrote a syntax analyzer program for the Jack high level language that parses jack programs according to the defined Jack grammar. The logic of this program would eventually be morphed into a full-scale compiler.

Project 11- Built a full-scale recursive descent compiler(without error handling) for the Jack programming language

Project 12- Built a simple operating system for the HACK computer(the computer built in the previous projects)
